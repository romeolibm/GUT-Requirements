# Requirements for GUT and LUT entities

1. There can be only one GUT in this reality
3. The GUT and LUTs have assigned binary namespaces identified in by unique (relative to the GUT) 64 bit random numbers
4. The GUT NSID is equal to 1
5. The GUT and LUT entities are human language independent
6. Connecting GUT/LUT entities to human lanaguages is done via Labels, names and symbols that can be linked to GUT/LUT entities
8. The GUT is built from LUTs by using well defined publishing and merging procedures from all people and groups of people on earth
9. The GUT is a public open repository of information used to describe entities from both the real and imaginary domains by using binary identities for all entities used to describe an entity such as base entities and their attributes (or parameters, etc)
10. Each human or group of humans can create and maintin one or more LUTs they can publish to the GUT without impacting the GUT or other LUTs bcause of unique NSIDs and WORM object architecture 
5. The uniqueness of a LUT NSIDs is verified against the list of LUT namespaces registered in the GUT repository
6. LUT NSID can be anonimized
7. The GUT entity structures are fully defined via a set of 3 dimension T-uples (ent-id,attr-id,component-d/atomc-value)
11. Connecting LUTs to The GUT are done via LUT-GUT identity mapping that allows for independent binary namespaces for the GUT and any LUT out there
13. This repository will define a minimal core set of entities that will be used to define basic entities and thier structures in any LUT in order to bootstrap the process of building LUTs and in time consolidating them in the GUT
14. The core set of entities will be fully documented in this repository
15. The first entity of the GUT is the "root" entity, a fully abstract entity that serves nly as an initial anchor (or starting point for any other entity in a LUT directoy or indirectly via inheritance
16. ?
