# GUT-Requirements
Basic requirements for data architecture and tools implementation for building a GUT (Global Universal Taxonomy) and the LUT (Local Universal Taxonomy)

1. There can be only a single GUT in this reality
2. The GUT and each LUT have a binary namespace identified in by a unique (relative to the GUT) 64 bit random number. The GUT NSID is equal to 1. The uniqueness of a LUT_NSID is verified against the list of LUT namespaces registered in the GUT repository. LUT_NSID can be anonimized.
3. The GUT is human language independent
4. The GUT is built from individual LUTs (Local Universal Taxonomies) by using well defined publishing and merging procedures
5. The GUT is a public open repository of information used to describe entities from both the real and imaginary domains by using binary identities for all entities used to describe an entity such as base entities and their attributes (or parameters, etc)
6. The GUT entity structures are fully defined via 3 dimension T-uples (ent-id,attr-id,component-d/atomc-value)
7. Connecting LUTs to The GUT are done via LUT-GUT identity mapping that allows for independent binary namespaces for the GUT and any LUT out there
8. GUT/LUT entities can be named and Labelaed in human lanaguages by mapping Names, Labels or Symbols to LUT entities only
9. This repository will define a minimal core set of entities that will be used to define basic entities and thier structures in any LUT in order to bootstrap the process of building LUTs and in time consolidating them in the GUT
10. The core set of entities will be fully documented in this repository
11. The first entity of the GUT is the "root" entity, a fully abstract entity that serves nly as an initial anchor (or starting point for any other entity in a LUT directoy or indirectly via inheritance
12. ?
